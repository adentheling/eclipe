# Eclipe

Eclipe is a collection of Python scripts for generating, manipulating, and visualizing ellipses, spirals, and their transformations. This project includes tools that:

- Generate ellipse points and export them as CSV files.
- Visualize 2D and 3D representations using Turtle graphics, Matplotlib, Plotly, and SVG outputs.
- Map 2D ellipse points onto a cylinder.
- Create nested ellipses with scarf joint transitions.
- Provide interactive features (e.g., measuring distances on plots).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. The scripts require the following Python libraries:
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **plotly**

Install them via pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib plotly
```

> **Note:** The built-in `turtle` and `csv` modules are included with Python.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adentheling/eclipe.git
cd eclipe
```

## Scripts Overview

### 3dcsvplot.py
- **Purpose:** Reads sticker coordinates from `sticker_coordinates.csv` and creates a 3D scatter plot (with connecting lines) using Plotly.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python 3dcsvplot.py
  ```

### 3dmodelwrappy.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Reads ellipse points from `ellipse_points.csv`.
  - Rotates the points.
  - Maps them onto a cylinder (mimicking a 3D wrap).
  - Exports the mapped points as `sticker_coordinates.csv`.
  - Visualizes the original, rotated, and mapped points using Matplotlib (including a 3D view).
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python 3dmodelwrappy.py
  ```

### checkcsv.py
- **Purpose:** Uses Turtle graphics to draw ellipse points from `ellipse_points.csv` and applies a color gradient based on each pointâ€™s distance from the origin.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python checkcsv.py
  ```

### checkcsvMATPLOT.py
- **Purpose:** Reads ellipse points from `ellipse_points.csv` and visualizes them using Matplotlib with a color gradient. It also draws lines between consecutive points and supports interactive distance measurement via mouse clicks.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python checkcsvMATPLOT.py
  ```

### eclipgen.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Generates evenly spaced points along an ellipse.
  - Draws the ellipse along with dynamically scaled axes (using Turtle).
  - Exports the generated points to `ellipse_points.csv`.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python eclipgen.py
  ```

### in to bbox.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Generates nested ellipses with scarf joints inside a bounding ellipse.
  - Adjusts point density and applies a dynamic Y offset.
  - Exports the ellipse points to `ellipse_points.csv`.
  - Visualizes the nested ellipses using Matplotlib.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python "in to bbox.py"
  ```
  *(If your OS or shell does not allow spaces in filenames, consider renaming the file.)*

### main.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Provides functions to calculate ellipse coordinates.
  - Prints the coordinates to the console.
  - Draws the ellipse points using Turtle graphics.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
  > **Note:** This script requires user input for the semi-major and semi-minor axes.

### out to in spiral.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Generates nested ellipses starting from an outer ellipse and gradually reducing until the final transition reaches (0,0).
  - Exports the inner ellipse points (excluding the outermost ellipse) to `ellipse_points.csv`.
  - Visualizes the transition using Matplotlib.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python "out to in spiral.py"
  ```

### spiral to SVG.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Similar to the "out to in spiral" approach but designed to produce an SVG file.
  - Exports ellipse points to `ellipse_points.csv` and saves the final plot as `nested_ellipses_spiral.svg`.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python "spiral to SVG.py"
  ```

### spiraleclipSPACINGEQUALPOINT.py
- **Purpose:** 
  - Generates nested ellipses with scarf joints while enforcing equal spacing between points.
  - Exports the ellipse points (excluding the bounding ellipse) to `ellipse_points.csv`.
  - Visualizes the ellipses using Matplotlib.
- **Usage:**  
  ```bash
  python spiraleclipSPACINGEQUALPOINT.py
  ```

## Usage Examples

1. **Generating Ellipse Points and Visualizing with Turtle**  
   Run the ellipse generator to create points and see them drawn:
   ```bash
   python eclipgen.py
   ```

2. **Mapping 2D Points to a 3D Cylinder**  
   After generating `ellipse_points.csv`, map them onto a cylinder:
   ```bash
   python 3dmodelwrappy.py
   ```

3. **Visualizing with Plotly in 3D**  
   Use the exported `sticker_coordinates.csv` to create a 3D plot:
   ```bash
   python 3dcsvplot.py
   ```

4. **Interactive 2D Plot with Matplotlib**  
   Visualize the ellipse points with interactive distance measurement:
   ```bash
   python checkcsvMATPLOT.py
   ```

5. **Creating Nested Ellipses with Scarf Joints**  
   Generate and view nested ellipses, then export the points:
   - For an "in to bounding" version:  
     ```bash
     python "in to bbox.py"
     ```
   - For an "outer to inner spiral" version:  
     ```bash
     python "out to in spiral.py"
     ```
   - For generating an SVG output:  
     ```bash
     python "spiral to SVG.py"
     ```
   - For equal spacing between points in nested ellipses:  
     ```bash
     python spiraleclipSPACINGEQUALPOINT.py
     ```
